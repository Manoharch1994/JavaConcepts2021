		//HashTable stores the Values on the Basis of Key and Value Pair.
		//HashTable is similar to HashMap.
		//HashTable is Synchronized and It is Thread Safe.
		//One Thread can access Only one HashTable Object at a Time.
		//So, The Performance of the Application will be Slow.
		//Key will be stored in the Form of Object --> HashCode --> Value.
		//Put method is used to add Data into HashTable.
		//Null Keys and Null Values are not Allowed in HashTable.
